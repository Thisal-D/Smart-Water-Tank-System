# Arduino Firmware for Smart Water Tank System

This directory contains the embedded code for the ESP32 microcontroller, managing all sensor readings, pump/alert control, and communication with the backend server.

---

## ‚ú® Responsibilities

- Read water level (Ultrasonic) and TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensors
- Control Relay (water pump), LEDs, and buzzer based on logic
- Communicate with backend server (HTTP over Wi-Fi)
- Respond to commands from web/mobile apps

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install Arduino IDE**: [Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. **Select Board:** ESP32 (via Tools ‚Üí Board)
3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - `ArduinoJson`
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
4. **Configure Network:**
   - Edit `sketch_oct6a.ino` to set your Wi-Fi credentials and server IP:
     ```cpp
     const String serverUrl = "http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:5000";
     ```
5. **Upload Firmware:** Use the IDE to upload to your ESP32.

## üìé Additional Notes

- Ensure the ESP32 and backend server are on the same local network.
- Adjust pin assignments in code if your hardware layout differs.
